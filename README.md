# Pong Game with AI using NEAT | Python

Welcome to the Pong Game with AI project! In this project, I have created a classic Pong game in Python with a unique twist. I've integrated the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to create an adaptive AI opponent, making the game more challenging and engaging.

## About the Project

### Features:
- Developed a Pong game in Python with player controls, scoring, and ball physics.
- Integrated the NEAT algorithm to create an adaptive AI opponent, enhancing the game's challenge and engagement.

### Why NEAT?
NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that can evolve neural networks to perform various tasks. In this project, we use NEAT to train the AI to play Pong. The AI starts with a simple neural network and evolves over time through generations to become a more formidable opponent. This approach ensures that the AI adapts and becomes more challenging as the player improves.
